# ðŸ›’ Products Manager

**Products Manager** is a simple backend API built with Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL to help manage the products of a small store. It allows you to:

- View all available products (public access)
- Add, update, and delete products (admin-only access)

This app is designed to serve as the backend for a product inventory system, and it's easily extendable for use with a frontend (e.g., built with Vite/React).
